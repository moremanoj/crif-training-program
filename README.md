# Demo preparedness: (code is done)

1. Application flow (diagram)
2. Technologies used ( Node, Express, Seneca, mocha, dockers, k8s)
3. Code walkthrough (folder structure) 
    a. Eslint
    b. Babel
    c. debugging configuration
    d. Test configuration 
4. Build generation (web pack)
5. Dockerfile config for each application/repo 
6. Kubernetes config in one place at k8s (included and done things - will do things )
7. async implementation via: seneca-amqp-transport
8. Code should run containerized ( inprogress )




=======================================

1. loggers needs to be level wise and 
2. keep repo separate along with k8s


=======================================
1. this need to be included in kube files process.env.<variable>
2. loggers proper for each logs of repl apigateway and course =>  port, mapping, act etc
